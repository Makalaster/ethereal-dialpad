# ethereal-dialpad
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, so has Ethereal Dialpad been reborn.

### About
The expressive touch synthesizer. Turn up, tap in, dial out.

This incarnation of Ethereal Dialpad is based on an old project of the same name by [Adam Smith](https://adamsmith.as/). A few years ago some friends and I realized the original app was no longer being maintained and had been removed from the Play Store. I managed to find Adam Smith on social media and asked him for permission to rebuild and reupload it, to which he said "please do whatever you like with the [source](https://adamsmith.as/typ0/k/EtherealDialpad.zip) (consider it under the MIT license) so long as you do it under your own name." And now we're here!

### Instructions

##### Use
1. Open the app
2. Select a Pad
3. Swipe around to make lights and sounds!
4. Tap once in a pad to expose the top app bar. The three dots menu item brings up a bottom sheet with per-pad settings. I hope to update this with more audio options and visual options for each pad

##### Build
1. Install the latest [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Clone the project to your local environment and import it into Android Studio
3. Run the project on a physical device or emulator
